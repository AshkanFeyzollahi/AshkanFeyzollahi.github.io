        <p>
            My journey in programming began four years ago, and since
            then, I have expanded my skillset to encompass seven
            different programming languages. With each language, I
            strive to not only master its syntax but also understand
            its underlying philosophy and principles.

        <p>
            I'm a 16-year-old programmer with
            proficiency in Python and JavaScript.
            In addition to coding, I enjoy playing
            chess and exploring the exciting world of
            machine learning and computer science from
            the comfort of my own home.

                <h3>Backend development</h3>
                <p>
                    I have advanced skills in building backends using
                    various technologies. Specifically, I excel in
                    utilizing FastAPI and Flask for backend development
                    projects. These powerful tools enable me to create
                    efficient, reliable, and flexible solutions for
                    businesses seeking to optimize their operations.

                <h3>Software development</h3>
                <p>
                    I am an accomplished software developer with
                    expertise across multiple languages and platforms.
                    I primarily use C# and the .NET Framework for
                    building robust and scalable desktop applications,
                    as well as Node.js and Electron for server-side and
                    cross-platform development needs. Additionally, I
                    have experience in Python 3 and Tkinter for
                    scripting and rapid application prototyping.

                <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    I primarily rely on Python 3 and its
                    popular libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and
                    Matplotlib, to clean, manipulate, visualize, and
                    derive insights from large datasets. By applying
                    statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, 
                    and other analytical approaches, I help
                    organizations gain valuable insights and inform
                    decision-making processes.

                <h3>Game development</h3>
                <p>
                    I am an experienced game developer with a passion
                    for creating engaging and interactive experiences.
                    I primarily use Unity to build complex and dynamic
                    games, taking full advantage of its powerful
                    features to create immersive worlds, lifelike
                    characters, and intuitive interfaces. In addition,
                    I employ PyGame as another tool in my arsenal,
                    using it to create simpler, 2D games that cater to
                    unique creative visions or niche audiences.
